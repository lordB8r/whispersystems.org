Open Whisper Systems is a project focused on developing Open Source security and privacy apps for the
mobile environment.  With all of the recent discussion about [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program%29)), 
[Boundless Informant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundless_Informant), and 
[FISA orders](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order),
there has been a surge of new users and inquiries about how to get involved.

If you're interested in the project, here are some ways to help out Open Whisper Systems:

* **Use the software and provide feedback.**  One of the best ways to help is by providing valuable user feedback.
  Install [TextSecure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms) or
  [RedPhone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.redphone) and file bugs you encounter 
  or features you feel are missing [on the issue tracker](https://github.com/whispersystems/textsecure/issues).
* **Help spread the word!** Tell a friend.
* **Translate to non-English languages.**  Localizing the software for different regions helps ensure we can distribute
  it as widely as possible.  You can help with translation by joining the Transifex translation
  teams for [TextSecure](https://transifex.com/projects/p/textsecure-official) and 
  [RedPhone](https://transifex.com/projects/p/redphone).
* **Contribute code.** If you're a software developer, pull requests are invaluable.  A
  good place to start is with any of the many [outstanding issues](https://github.com/whispersystems) on GitHub.
  If there are features or other areas of interest that you're drawn to -- get in touch, or just get started.
* **Design.** If you're a designer, we are in dangerous need of assistance. If you get in touch we can send you
  a current list of areas we need help with (as if it isn't already obvious).
* **Funding.** Lastly, if you don't have any time to spare, but still want to contribute, we accept Bitcoin:
